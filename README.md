# Python-Cal_College-Project
This is a simple project I made in college (for a final project). 
It is a personal calendar, allowing user to add, delete or show the events. It also has the ability to import and export the data from/to a text file.

TO RUN:
- Clone the repo.
- Open the calendar project folder in terminal.
- Make sure you have python installed in your local computer.
- run the use_calendar.py using python use_calendar.py or py use_calendar.py.

NOTES:
- To get help and see the list of commands, type "help".
- To quit, type "quit".
- The application will automatically save data to a text file called "calendar.txt" on exit. It will read and import this file upon running.
